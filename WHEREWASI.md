Things I need to do next:
- update to Bevy 0.10
- always dim computer player power-up buttons (so the human player doesn't think they can click those buttons)
- teach computer players how to use power-ups
- change evade capture icon to a shield
- add icons to show active power ups (ex: show a transparent-ish shield over all evading marbles)
