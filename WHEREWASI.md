I just _kinda_ got the power-up buttons to spawn correctly (no icon yet).

Things I need to do next:
- stop hiding power-up buttons when it's not the human player's turn (hiding the 'Done' button is okay)
- make the human player power-up buttons clickable (not sure why they aren't yet)
- actually handle a power-up button click
    - activate the power-up
    - remove the power-up button

Things I need to eventually do:
- change the power bar to be only one 'level' (not three)
- don't take power-ups away once they're earned
